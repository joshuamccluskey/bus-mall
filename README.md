#### Reflections and Comments:

I found this lab to be difficult in trying to figure out how to generate 3 different random numbers. I tried numerous of nested loop conditions to see if I could figure out how to get three unique number, but as soon as I change one I fall into this logical trap that I spent too much time trying to figure out. Overall, I thought this exercise took longer trying to figure out the three random number problem.
