Bus mall lab for Code Fellows

## LAB - 11 Bus Mall

Build an app to test which items customers click on the most when given a choice of three items. They can only have 25 rounds for clicking. The results must show the number of clicks per image and how times it was viewed.

#### Reflections and Comments

I found this lab to be difficult in trying to figure out how to generate 3 different random numbers. I tried numerous of nested loop conditions to see if I could figure out how to get three unique number, but as soon as I change one I fall into this logical trap that I spent too much time trying to figure out. Overall, I thought this exercise took longer trying to figure out the three random number problem.

## LAB - 12 Chart

Build a bar chart to display to easily display the data for clicks and views of the items. Also eliminate bias in test by not showing same images in the next step shown to the user.

#### Reflections and comments

Trying figure out the bias problem is leading me down logical rabbit holes trying to figure out the best order to use array methods. Overall, this problem feels very similar to yesterday's problem trying to generate three different number. I tried to use a for each loop, but I ended up emptying out my array. I definitely need to come back with a fresh view to approach the solution and figure out a better solution.

## LAB - 13 Local Storage

Connect the site to local storage, and make sure the data presists through multiple rounds each time the browser resets.

#### Reflections and comments

At first I thought it would go a lot faster to complete, but I ran into issues. I found that if you use simple variable names there is a high possibility that there is a chance its used within a method. After spending more than an hour troubleshooting why my data didn't presist, I went and changed my variable names again to be more unique, and it worked -- a lessoned learned. Overall, it was the easiest lab we've had this week.
